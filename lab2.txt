1) [As proposed in handout]
    Timeout implementation set by setsockopt on the server side and logs out corresponding user,
    update client-side by killing according threads
2) [Accepted on piazza]
    - client that creates a session becomes the admin of that session
    - admin can kick anyone in that session (/kickout <clientID> ) or make someone else the admin instead (/promote <clientID> )
    - a kicked user can still rejoin
    - if admin is timed-out due to (1), leaves a session or logout
     without transfering admin status to someone else in the session,
     the admin would have taken the passive decision to delete admin status in that session (all users are equal)
     the ex-admin can rejoin that session but will be equal to all in the session without an admin status
